This is miniRT, a lightweight radiative transfer (RT) code. It is not written 
to be efficient but rather is intended for use as a tool to validate RT codes 
using simple test cases. It is written in a straight-forward manner that 
follows how a human thinks about RT.

MiniRT takes inputs as command-line arguments. 
See miniRT.py for more information.

Users are free to contribute to the code via pull requests.
